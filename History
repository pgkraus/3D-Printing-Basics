# History
## First 3D printer ever
The first patented 3D printing technology ever was, **surprisingly**, a laser-based SLA printer invented by Chuck Hull, founder of 3D Systems, who filed his patent in 1986.

SLA printing is expensive, complicated, messy, and still notb very popular to this day.  As you've alreayd learned in [types of 3D printers](https://github.com/pgkraus/3D-Printing-Basics/blob/main/Types), FDM printers dominate the market today.
## First FDM printer  
Just two years after the patent for the first SLA printer was filed, Scott Crump, co-founder of [**_Stratasys_**](https://www.stratasys.com/) filed his patent for the first FDM based 3D printer.

## Rliable 3D printers become affordable  
In 2009, Josef Prusa developed the RepRap Mendel as part of the open source RepRap project.  It was designed to be built at home with 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components.

Eventually, the RepRap mendel evolved into the Prusa i3, which is the basis of nearly all of the multitude of modern, affordable, DIY 3D printer kits on the market today.
