# Types of 3D Printers  
There are **Three** main types of 3D printers commonly used today:  
+ SLA Printers
+ FDM Printers
+ SLS Printers

### SLA Printers 
SLA stands for [stereolithography][stereo] and it is a form of resin printing.  This means that it involves hardening a liquid resin in order to produce the print.  Typically, SLA printers use a UV laser directed by a series of motor-controlled mirrors to cure a UV-sensitive photopolymer resin into the desired shape, layer by layer.  Newer and chepaer SLA printers use an LCD display backlit by a UV light to cure entire layers at a time.

### FDM Printers 
FDM stands for [Fused Deposition Modeling][fused], sometimes also called FFF or Fused Filament Fabrication.  This is by far the most popular and afordable 3D printing technology today.  FDM printers also print inhorizontal layers and form these layers in lines like a laser-based SLA machine.  However, these types of printers do so by extruding thermoplastic filament  through a heated nozzle.  Think of it like a hot glue gun attached to a 3-axis CNC machine.

### SLS Printers 
SLS stands for [Selective Laser Sintering][selective].  This technlogy involves using a laser to heat and fuse powdered polymers or metals, ina very similar fashion to how laser-based  SLA machines work.  Thyese are some of the most promising for industrial, medical, and aerospace applications due to the ability to print with nearly any metal.
